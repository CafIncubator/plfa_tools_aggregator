## Purpose

The MIDI Inc. Sherlock PLFA Analysis Software has a paid add-on package called PLFA Tools. The software takes as input GC results of PLFA (and NLFA) samples and assigns peaks to categories (General FAME, Gram Negative, etc.). The software creates a new Excel Worksheet for each sample, resulting in 100s of worksheets of various formats. The purpose of this package is to automate the aggregation of the data into a single csv file for analysis.
